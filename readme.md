# Deprecated

This would make more sense if it was written using Deno, or a compiled language
like Go or Rust.

Email me to `eliaz.bobadilladev@gmail.com` if you create a similar tool, so I
will link it here.

# Denoc

Compile Deno executables and compress them for all platforms easily ðŸš€

## Install

You can install [denoc](https://pypi.org/project/denoc) from PyPI like any other
package:

```bash
pip install denoc
```

From Github ðŸ‘‡

```bash
pip install git+https:/github.com/UltiRequiem/denoc
```

## Usage

### Basic usage

```bash
denoc compileMe.ts
```

This will make a directory (`deno_builds`) with executables for all the
supported platforms.

Optional flags:

```bash
denoc --outputDir deno_dir_output --compress True file.ts
```

- `outputDir`: The directory where the binaries will be, by default the
  directory is _deno_build_

- `compress`: Compress the binaries directory
